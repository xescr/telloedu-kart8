# Tello-Edu Kart 8 Deluxe
### (Not Affiliated With Nintendo)
Because I wanted to make use of the EDU drones that are for lack of a better word,
shit, and the VR headsets that do not even support steam (for some god forsaken 
reason) I decided with the nimble movement and overabundance of api protocalls 
I would design a program utilising the htc focus controllers for a bit of fun
## Install Instructions
chill out the app isnt finished yet, if you just wanna investigated clone the repo I guess

## State Of The Software
Currently I am without access to both the HTC Focus and DJI Tello 
so I am mainly building the programs
